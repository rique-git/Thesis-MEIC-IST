Observations:

The data does not have null values, however it contains inconsistent values and anomalies, with people older than 30 with 10kg or 50cm, there are a high number of blood pressures lower than 40 and higher than 200 which is impossible. And overall these are not only outliers, but have relevant impact on the data distribution considering the amount of impossible data values. This dataset does not seem real at all. It would need to be cleaned, with outliers removed, but still then the data is inconsistent and irreliable.
